                <h3>A native of the Washington D.C. metro area, I grew up constantly inquisitive of my surroundings. I liked, and still do like, a change of pace - always trying any activity I could get my hands on. I am currently a senior at Indiana University's Media School and am seeking a full-time job.</h3>

                <h2>What I value.</h2>
                <h3>I believe that yes is always the answer.</h3>
                <p>There is always a way to tackle any task. This is a mantra that I hold close and keep in mind to every project I undertake.</p>
                <h3>Passion is everything.</h3>
                <p>Tell me what you're passionate about and don't shut up. If you don't enjoy what you're doing, and don't think it's important to share with others too, why are you doing it? I like to surround myself with inspiration and motivated people who love what they do, and I hope I can do the same for others.</p>
                <h3>Always learn.</h3>
                <p>There's no such thing as knowing too much. I am always looking at ways to challenge and expand my knowledge. This is why in my spare time I like to read novels, explore museums, and get out of my comfort zone. Ask me for recommendations!</p>

                <h2>Chat with me about:</h2>
                <h3>Emerging technologies.</h3>
                <p>I geek out over every new tool coming our way - especially AI and ML. Yet, I am cautiously aware of their potential effects. I'm interested in exploring the intersections between them and media.</p>
                <h3>Anything fashion-related.</h3>
                <p>At one point in my life, I thought I was going to pursue fashion design in college. I grew up learning how to sew, and even made my dresses for homecoming in high school! I like to create pieces as a hobby, but I am always seeking and studying the latest trends. (Huge fan of Leandra Medine and Eva Chen! Their kiddos are super cute, too.)</p>
                <h3>Globetrotting.</h3>
                <p>I recently lived in London for a semester and caught the travel bug. I am fascinated by other cultures and want to immerse myself in more! I believe that traveling is the best thing money can buy, and I'm always looking at @thepointsguy, @contexttravel, and @cntraveler for my next trip idea.</p>
                <h3>Planning events.</h3>
                <p>I love events because they're the perfect combination of planning and last-minute problem-solving. Previously, I have run recruitment events for my sorority, and for prospective college students at Dormify.</p>
                <h3>Cooking.</h3>
                <p>Growing up with a family full of chefs, how could I not love cooking? There's nothing like hosting a great dinner party that includes extravagant cocktails, an elaborate charcuterie board, and some homemade gnocchi. Not to mention, a great playlist to elevate the ambiance. Though I will admit, Annie's white cheddar mac n' cheese is never a bad idea.</p>
